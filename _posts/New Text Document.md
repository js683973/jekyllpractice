title: "From Hugo to Jekyll"
---

Below is what I did for the first blogging with Hugo, but failed technically.

Hello Hugo world!
:D

To start this blog, I referred to instructions on a website: https://opensource.com/article/18/3/start-blog-30-minutes-hugo. For building it to my github account, I also referred to a real blog webpage made by Hugo which explains how to use the git push command: https://ialy1595.github.io/post/blog-construct-1/. The latter is written in Korean, so easy for me to read out.

For doing the Ubuntu assignment, it was more difficult and harder than I expected. Now I have total three Linux systems installed on my VirtualBox: Ubuntu for this class, and the others - CentOS and Kali linux. Computer is always interesting for me, but Iâ€™d never say it is easy to go.

* Hugo failed. I don't know why. Even now I cannot publish my website. So instead of Hugo, I decided to go with Jekyll because it is more Github-friendly. Also instead of using a vi editor on Linux (Ubuntu), now I'm editing this file content on Github website itself.
